Navigating the menu.
All the menus are navigated using numbers given to each option in the menus.
If you need to do otherwise, the program will let you know.
Initially, you can only access 'Load data' and 'Quit', until data has been loaded.
Once you have done this, a set of aggrigation options, statistics, plots, etc. are available to you.

Load data function.
In the load data function, you will be asked to write the filename of the data file you want to load (including the '.csv'-extension).
Additionally, you can write 'return' in the console to return to the main menu.
Notice: You are only able to load files of the type '.csv'.

Aggregation menu.
You are able to aggregate your data to look at hourly, daily, monthly, hourly average and daily average electricity consumption.
The first three functions display the total electricity consumption for the chosen parameter over the entire data set. 
The last two display the average use of electricity per hour or per day, for the total data set. 
This data can be plotted using the 'Visualize electricity consumption'.

Raw data
Display the current data as a matrix.
